<!-- A scroll indicator doesn't show up if there isn't enough

	<h1>Space filling article</h1>

	<p>Sometimes you just need to take up space. This is a great way to do so, as it looks sort of professional, and fills up quite a bit of space. The user can even read it if he/she wants to, and learn how to make their own space filling article of mass destruction.
		Or maybe not mass destruction, but I don't know.</p>

	<h3>Step 1: Asses Why This is Necessary</h3>

	<p>Why do you need a space filling article in the first place? Maybe it's because you are doing a tutorial or showcase about scroll bars, or scroll indicators, or thermonuclear war - who knows, you might need it. If you decide that a space filling article
		is the thing for you, then so is this article/tutorial/teaching thingy.</p>

	<h3>Step 2: Come up with a topic</h3>

	<div class="quote-container">
		<p class="quote-text">A topic's a topic no matter how random.</p>
		<p class="quote-author">Dr. Moose*</p>
	</div>

	<p>Coming up with a topic is not that hard. In fact, this article about space filling articles is actually a space filling article itself! I came up with this topic so that I could test a scroll position indicator. I didn't actually do this to provide the
		world with quality, useful information. I know, shame on me, but it works. I get to test my scroll position thingymajig without the style of the standard 'Lorem ipsum' space fillers. By the way, if anyone knows what language that is, tell me.  I think it is Latin. Now, hopping off that tangent, I will proceed to talk more about random topic choosing just so that I can fill up my page. Just choose the first thing that comes into your head and write an article about it. Don't worry, feel free to go off on
		tangents, talk about other random things, or even just type one word per line; <strong>no one cares</strong>. This is your space filling article and sould be of no concern to anyone other than yourself.  If anyone decides to berate you about it for any reason, do what you need to do to make them stop**.</p>
	<p>--</p>
	<p>*The 'Dr. Moose' in question is a figment of my imagination and is not referenced to a certain person in any way, shape, or form.</p>
	<p>**I assume no responsibility for any conflict and/or injuries that are caused by the statement in question.  Using physical force to solve problems is not the way to do things, we have been learning that since kindergarten.  Why the supposedly smartest people in the world, namely our leaders, use guns, bombs, missiles, tanks, and heavy artillery to solve problems is beyond me and is not to be compared to our situation.</p>
	
	<h3>Step 3: Write</h3>
	
	<p>Writing is always a good thing when trying to write an article.  It actually is impossible to <strong>write</strong> an article without actually <strong>writing</strong>.  I guess you could have someone write it for you; then <strong>you</strong> wouldn't technically be writing it, but because manual labor is a good character building device, I am going to ask that you please do this yourself.  You can not employ, ask, or even blackmail someone to do this for you, or by the official book of Space Filling Article Rules, it doesn't count.  Just kidding.  There's no such thing, so feel free to do whatever you like.<br> <strong>Disclaimer: Blackmailing is not reccomended.  I reccomend either the employ or ask options.</strong></p>
